## Description
The goal of this project is to design and implement a secure chat system with end-to-end encryption. The chat system will ensure that messages are encrypted on the senderâ€™s device and only decrypted by the intended recipient. This means that even if an adversary intercepts the communication (e.g., over a network), they cannot read the messages. The project will focus on developing cryptographic techniques for key exchange, secure message encryption, and potential defenses against common attack vectors like man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

## Key Features 
- One-on-one messaging 
- End-to-end encryption using the Signal Protocol
- Secure password storage with the bcrypt algoritgm

## Technologies Used
**Languages** 
- Python
- JavaScript
- SQLite3

**Frameworks**
- Flask
- React
